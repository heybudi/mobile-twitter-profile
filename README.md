# Mobile Twitter Profile using Tailwind CSS
This is a static version of [mobile Twitter profile](https://mobile.twitter.com) built using [Taildwind CSS Framework](https://taildwindcss.com). Static means no interactivity like dropdowns or modals. To make it easy, I use Tailwind Webpack starter pack [here](https://github.com/tailwindcss/webpack-starter). I also added few sizing values into `tailwind.js`.

To get started, clone the project and install the dependencies:
```
# Using npm
npm install
```

After that, start up Webpack Development Server:
```
npm run dev
```

Webpack Development Server will watch `/src/styles.css` and `/tailwind.js` and rebuild your stylesheet on every change.

You can play around with `/index.html` to see the effects of your changes.
